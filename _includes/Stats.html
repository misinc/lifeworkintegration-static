Best of all, it's a very realistic approach and easy to manage. &nbsp;It allowed me to consistently                         lead my company for over 20 years, &nbsp;start new ventures, fence competitively for over 40 years, become a 3 time over 40/50                         national champion and represent the USA 6 times at the over 50 World Fencing Championships.</p> <p class="lead">Along the way, I have facilitated successful retreats and workshops for EO chapters and forums in the USA, Africa, China, India, South America, as well as Vistage groups, YPO led companies and forums.&nbsp;I've served on several boards and 14 years as a member leader for the Entrepreneur's                         Organization (EO), from Chapter President to Regional Director, to Chair for the Global Growth Team. It’s been an incredible journey                         so far – and when you are ready to take your own on, I will be there to guide.</p> <p class="lead">&nbsp;</p> <p class="lead">Best of success to you in life &amp; work, Jamie Douraghy</p></div>
