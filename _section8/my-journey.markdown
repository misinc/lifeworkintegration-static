I wasn't the only one affected by my new outlook and way of thinking; colleagues, clients, friends and family saw the transformation I was committed to accomplishing. Best of all, it's a very realistic approach and easy to manage. It allowed me to consistently lead my company for over 20 years, start new ventures, fence competitively for over 40 years, become a 3 time over 40/50                         national champion and represent the USA 6 times at the over 50 World Fencing Championships.
Along the way, I have facilitated successful retreats and workshops for EO chapters and forums in the USA, Africa, China, India, South America, as well as Vistage groups, YPO led companies and forums. I've served on several boards and 14 years as a member leader for the Entrepreneur’s Organization (EO), from Chapter President to Regional Director, to Chair for the Global Growth Team. It’s been an incredible journey                         so far – and when you are ready to take your own on, I will be there to guide.

Best of success to you in life & work, Jamie Douraghy
